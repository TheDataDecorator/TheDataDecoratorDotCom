KYC procedures defined by banks involve all the necessary actions to ensure their customers are real, assess, and monitor risks.
These client-onboarding processes help prevent and identify money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illegal corruption schemes.
KYC process includes ID card verification, face verification, document verification such as utility bills as proof of address, and biometric verification.
Banks must comply with KYC regulations and anti-money laundering regulations to limit fraud. KYC compliance responsibility rests with the banks. 
In case of failure to comply, heavy penalties can be applied.

For reporting purposes, we can adopt a similar strategy with our stakeholders;
Determine your target audience, this is usually the requestor or requesting department. Get to know them, how they operate currently, what is working, what isn't and what the request is aiming to achieve.

You can "on-board" your stakeholders, just as a bank would vet their customers. Where a bank would take identification, it is likely that you already know the requestor, or their department. You may be familiar with their function but you can always know more. 

Knowing more about who you are delivering your product to will not only increase engagement but will likely leave you with less amendments to make come review time, as you will gain a greater understanding of their needs. 

Without knowing your "client", you might still be able to deliver the requirements however you will likely deliver a better product if you speak with the client and understand their wants and needs, rather than following the letter of the requirements document.

Why knowing your client matters:
* **It will increase trust** - If your client knows that you know what they are looking for, can articulate their requirements in their language, then they are more likely to trust the outputs and contents of your reports.
* **It will increase adoption** - building on the last point, if your client trusts that you know what they want, how they want it, then they are more likely to use the product you deliver to them.
* **It will decrease amendments and changes in scope** - When you speak to your clients prior to starting the project, you will have a greatuer understanding of their needs, and they will have a greater understanding of what can and be delivered.
